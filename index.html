          <h2>Microfinance</h2>
          <p class="facts">Facts: 80% of peple live off of $2 a day</p>
          <p>People living on less than US$2.50 a day urgently
            need reliable financial services.
            They need to be able to safely save,
            borrow, make payments and use insurance.
            But two billion people have no access to such
            services.</p>

            <p>Microfinance is a powerful self-help tool for the poor
             that is made stronger when coupled with complementary services that improve
             health, nutrition and food security,
              and connect smallholder farmers’ to training, information and markets.</p>
          <h3>However: <strong>
         Microfinance alone cannot stop the cycle of poverty!</strong></h3>

        <p class="facts">Fact: 2.2 billion people make their livelihoods through farming small plots of land</p>
        <p>Today, such smallholder farmers comprise the majority of the world’s poorest people, and half of all food-insecure households globally. </p>

          <p>To reach farmers at the “last mile” – especially women farmers who often shoulder the majority of farm labor with the least access to resources – we combine the use of digital technology, networks of skilled individuals in local communities, and a rich array of partners. </p>
